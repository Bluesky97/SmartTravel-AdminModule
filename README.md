# SmartTravel-AdminModule
Final Year Project - Travel Website (SmartTravel), It is an Admin Module. The features is to manage administration of public site such as payment, discount coupon, update or delete customers/attraction places/hotel/restaurant, update/delete review if the customers post on our website with the bad reviews to the our client/organisation site and we can automatically deactivate on his/her account by default. 

To run this project:
We suggest to set up the database SQL Server (SmartTravelDB) which is the same thing as our public website and to set the default page from the loginpage.aspx.
After that, click run button from the Visual Studio or Choose Loginpage.aspx to view from browser (Google Chrome - preferred).
